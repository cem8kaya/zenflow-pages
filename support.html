                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I get started with ZenFlow?</h4>
                    <p>Simply download the app and start your first breathing exercise or meditation session. No account or setup required! The app will guide you through each exercise with visual and haptic feedback.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Why isn't my data syncing across devices?</h4>
                    <p>ZenFlow is designed to work completely offline and stores all data locally on your device for maximum privacy. This means your data stays on the device where you use the app. We don't sync data across devices because we don't use cloud servers.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
